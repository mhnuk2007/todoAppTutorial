## **Step 1: Understand the Goal**

We are building a modern Todo application that allows users to:

- ✅ Add, edit, and delete tasks
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed or in progress
- ✅ Filter, search, and sort tasks
- ✅ Persist data using LocalStorage
- ✅ Use Angular signals for reactive state management
- ✅ Enjoy a beautiful, animated UI

## **Step 2: Create the Angular Project**

Create a new Angular application:

```bash
ng new todo-app
cd todo-app
ng serve
```

**During setup, choose:**
- ✅ CSS for styling
- ❌ No routing (for this simple app)

Your app will run at `http://localhost:4200`
